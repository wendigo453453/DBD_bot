        "news_text": "The PTB with numerous new features for Dead by Daylight will be released next week:Buying items within the bloodweb will be faster thanks to a new button that will automatically buy all the cheapest items until the canvas is completed, and it will also be possible to activate an option to buy items with a single button without having to hold down, and also an entire node.It will be possible to activate an option to make a red heart appear in the survivor when the killer is nearby and terror radius is activated:As mentioned a while ago, there will be changes within the Autohaven Wreckers realm, precisely the layouts of some map areas will be revised as well as the arrangement of pallets within Blood Lodge and Gas Heaven, in the latter map for example the gas station will be put more in the center of the map.Healing will now take 24 seconds and all medical kits have 24 charges by default, and the various rarities will differentiate for faster healing speed.There are also changes to some perks:- Gearhead will receive a slight rework: When a Survivor loses a Health State, Gearhead activates for 30 seconds. While active, any Survivor who hits a good skill check will have their aura revealed to the Killer for 6/7/8 seconds.- Overzealous will also activate when Blessing a Totem in addition to Cleansing. Weve also slightly increased the bonus to 8/9/10% (from 6/7/8%).- Scourge Hook: Pain Resonance starts with 4 tokens, the first time each Survivor is hooked on a Scourge Hook, the generator with the most progress will explode and lose progress. Weve also reduced the difference between different Tiers of the perk (now 11/13/15%).- Dead Hard will activate after safely unhooking a Survivor. When activated, press the active ability button while injured and running to gain the Endurance Status Effect for 0.5 seconds, then become Exhausted. Dead Hard will deactivate when it successfully protects the user from damage.- Call Of Brine: reduced the additional regression speed to 115/120/125% (was 150/175/200%). - Overcharge: reduced the maximum regression speed to 130% (was 200%). This would make it take longer for the regression rate to become beneficial, so at the same time, weve increased the starting regression speed to 85% (was 75%) to help offset this.- Boon: Circle of Healing will no longer allow Survivors to heal without a Med-Kit. Instead, it will provide a 40/45/50% healing speed bonus to healing others. This bonus will not apply to healing done with a Med-Kit. Additionally, the auras of injured Survivors with the Boons range will be revealed to all other Survivors.There are also changes to numerous killers and the interactions you can have with them using different items:There is also news regarding rifts:All of this will be possible to try out in the PTB that will be released on PC next week.What do you think about all this?"

        "news_link": "https://www.leaksbydaylight.com/dead-by-daylight-skull-merchant-news/",
        "news_text": "New changes are coming for Dead by Daylights new killer, The Skull Merchant:- The Skull Merchant will now gain a growing Haste effect for each Survivor tracked on her radar. This bonus starts at 3% for one Survivor, raises to 5% for two, 6% for three and 7% for four. Both Claw Traps and active drone zones will contribute to this, and the Killer does not need to inspect their scanner to gain the benefits. This will reward the Killer for efficiently using their Power to keep tabs on their prey.- Vaulting a pallet with a Claw Trap will cause that pallet to break, destroying the Claw Trap in the process. This was previously part of the common Ultrasonic Trap Speaker Add-on. With this change, being chased with a Claw Trap attached becomes a lot more dangerous.- Drones are no longer immediately returned to The Skull Merchant once they are disabled. Instead, they will be returned once their respective traps are destroyed. This will make it more difficult to replace disabled drones on these generators.- To ensure Survivors cannot hold a Claw Trap indefinitely to deny her from using her Power, Claw Traps will now be instantly destroyed as soon as their battery expires, and Claw Trap batteries will no longer refill when entering an active zone. This way, Claw Traps will always return after a set amount of time.- Drones will enter an unhackable state whenever a Survivor with a Claw Trap is near. This will prevent a single Survivor from running around and disabling every drone, meaning the Killer will always have some combination of four Claw Traps or drones available to them. Combined with the changes to Claw Traps mentioned above, The Skull Merchant will always get value out of her ability whether its through deployed drones or traps.There are also changes to some add-ons:- Ultrasonic Trap Speaker: Ultrasonic Trap Speaker now reduces the time taken for Undetectable to take effect when inside an active zone by 50%.\n- Expired Batteries: Since Claw Traps now provide a Haste effect, this would make the Killer very fast at the start of the match in addition to revealing the Survivors positions. Therefore, we have reduced the duration of the Claw Traps Survivors spawn with to 40% of the normal battery life (was 150%).\n- Adaptive Lighting: Adaptive Lighting now increases the length of the Undetectable effect by 50% (was 20%).Finally, there is also a change regarding the screams within the game, in fact they will no longer be 3D screams but 2D screams, this means that it will no longer be possible to tell where the scream is coming from within the map, but it will be possible to hear it from any corner of the map itself.Excited about all this?"

Atomic Monster and Blumhouse are the ideal partners to craft Dead by Daylights killer entrance onto the big screen. says Stephen Mulrooney, Executive Vice President at Behaviour Interactive.\n\nIn Dead by Daylight the Behaviour team has created a love letter to the world of horror, building an incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains — perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation, adds James Wan, Atomic Monster Founder and CEO. Were big fans of the game at Atomic Monster, and are thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse to bring this frighteningly visceral world to the big screen.The names around this project are very important, but there is certainly one that stands out most of all: James Wan, author of such successful sagas as Saw, Insidious and The Conjuring.Jason Blum is currently looking for a director and a screenwriter. \nThe producers of the project are James Wan, Jason Blum and Stephen Mulrooney, and the executive producers are Behaviour Interactives Rmi Racine, Atomic Monsters Michael Clear and Judson Scott, Blumhouses Ryan Turek, and Striker Entertainments Russell Binder.What do you think about it?"

        "news_text": "After the excessive coincidences between the last chapter of Dead by Daylight and Predator, I told you about the fact that Predator is probably actually coming to Dead by Daylight in June:Also because the anniversary chapters, except for a few times, has always been in collaboration with some license, and all those Predator-themed clues contained in the last chapter could actually mean teasers to the next upcoming licensed content.There is, however, another license that has always been wanted by the Dead by Daylight community, namely the collaboration with Alien, which a few years ago was also the victim of a fake image that made fans hope for the actual arrival of the creature within the game:I then told you about the probable arrival of the chapter on Alien for the seventh anniversary already last year, on more than one occasion:But lets take a step back for a moment: what is Alien?For those who dont know what Im talking about, Alien was born in 1979 from an idea by Dan OBannon and Ronald Shusett, directed by Ridley Scott and produced by 20th Century Fox, still considered one of the masterpieces of Ridley Scott and one of the best science fiction films ever. After the incredible success of the first film, others followed, with some crossover films with Predator, but no film succeeded in surprising as the first of Ridley Scott.Since 1979, the fanbase of Alien has become huge, and huge is also the desire that the community has to see it on Dead by Daylight. On the other hand after the Demogorgon from Stranger Things, Ghostface from Scream, Pyramid Head from Silent Hill, the Nemesis from Resident Evil and all the other licensed contents, nothing seems impossible, and so dreaming is more than permissible, but there is something that could make these dreams, something actually real.The license of Alien in fact has found a way to assert itself in the world of video games thanks to Alien: Isolation, a first-person shooter horror game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA in 2014, and that is considered one of the most successful horror single player games and one of the very few tie-ins worthy of note, with an incredible artificial intelligence and well-groomed technical side.From that moment on, fans of Alien began to grow even within video games, eager to see maybe an Alien: Isolation 2, which due to the uninspiring sales of the first chapter, has not yet become reality. And it is therefore on Dead by Daylight that all hopes are shifted to finally see Alien in a well-known horror product, after arriving on Fortnite in 2021.So why could Alien actually arrive on Dead by Daylight? The answer is very simple, never before as in this period, this license is being exploited in many ways in the videogames, from the 2021 Multiplayer CO-OP Aliens Fireteam Elite, to the 2021 collaboration with Fortnite I told you about before, the announcement a few months ago of a new Alien game in 2023, and also a new announcement months ago about another"

        "news_text": "A few days ago I anticipated to you that changes were coming to the Tools of Torment chapter after feedback from users within the PTB, and today a Developer Update was shared that tells the community what changes are taking place:1. Weve decoupled deploying drones from the powers cooldown. The cooldown is now solely used for reactivating existing drones, and furthermore has been lowered to 10 seconds (was 12.5). Once a drone is deployed, it would take 4 seconds to become active. This gave Survivors a lot of time to react and move away before it began locking on. For the release, we are lowering the initialization time of newly placed drones to 3 seconds.2. Were increasing the unhackable window to 10 seconds. Once the drone becomes hackable, it will remain active for an additional 20 seconds (for a total combined active time of 30 seconds, much like the PTB). The Killer can reactivate a drone at will using their scanner.3. Staying inside an active drones radius for 2 (from 3) seconds would grant you the Undetectable Status Effect, allowing you to ambush Survivors.4. More Changes as: \n- The Lock On duration has been increased to 60 seconds (was 30). \n- An incomplete Lock On will start to decay after 10 seconds of exiting an active zone (was 5). - Entering an active zone while Locked On will reset your Lock On to 60 seconds and prevent it from decaying until you leave the zone. - The Skull Merchant can now see Survivors Lock On progress in order to better plan their chases.- Claw Trap battery life has been increased to 45 seconds (was 25), allowing the Killer to track Survivors for longer. \n- The Overcharge Add-on has been adjusted accordingly. \n- Survivors will no longer receive an indicator when their location is revealed by The Skull Merchants scanner. -\nThe Skull Merchant will move faster when checking her radar (now 4.4m/s, was 4.0m/s). SFX have been updated to provide a clearer notification when a Survivor has been tracked.- Approaching a drone with a Claw Traps will no longer cause it to enter an unhackable state (preventing Survivors from interacting with it). \n- Survivors with a Claw Trap can now disable drones – but keep in mind that entering the drones range will cause it to activate and recharge your traps battery! \n- Survivors who fail a hack will now be immediately Locked OnAlso perks changes:- Eruptions regression will return to 10% of the generators total progress.- THWACK! will now remain active indefinitely upon hooking a Survivor and only deactivate upon use.- Background Player perk now activates when the Killer picks up another Survivor, and the duration of its sprint has been reduced to 4 seconds (was 6).I would also like to remind you that the chapter will be released on March 7, and several cosmetics have already been leaked coming soon:What do you think about all these changes?"
